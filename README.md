effectively and  in  a time  efficient manner according  to  there  taste  of  movies  so  as to  enhance there movie viewing experience and   hence they
do  not  end  up wasting  there time in searching or watching  movies they  may not  like (“most probably”) and  also  create  a  platform  for  content
